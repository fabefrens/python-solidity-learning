# PROGRAMATIC WAY OF INTERACTING WITH AAVE & DEFI
We won't deploy SC, because we only interact with AAVE, which is already deployed
When we deposit ETH, Aave is swapping it for WETH (an ERC20 version of ETH)

# Mint WETH in exchange for ETH
We look at the WETH contract in Kovan Etherscan to look at the functions
We need our scripts to call and interact with this Smart Contract. For this we need
    - ABI - We will do it via interfaces. We copy them from the github repo of Patrick (could not find it anywhere else)
    - Address - We look for it in Kovan Etherscan
We don't use get_contract() for simplicity because we will only use kovan or mainnet-fork
